In a scenario where a Microservices application experiences intermittent slowdowns, what monitoring strategy should be prioritized?
- Application Performance Monitoring

To maintain high availability, Microservices often use _________ to synchronize cache data.
- Replication

In an environment with frequent network partitions, what technique would be most effective for maintaining data consistency across Microservices?
- CAP Theorem ( It highlights the trade-offs between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance, guiding the choice of strategies for data consistency.)

In Microservices, how does the use of circuit breakers contribute to performance metrics?
- Circuit breakers help prevent cascading failures

To handle sudden spikes in traffic, the _________ load balancing strategy adapts in real-time by redistributing the requests.
- Adaptive Load Balancing

For achieving fault isolation, Microservices often use the _________ pattern.
- Bulkhead (Latency in one service should not migrate to the whole system)

- Real User Monitoring

How does service discovery handle the dynamic scaling of services in microservices architectures?
- Client-based Discovery

In a case where a Microservices application needs to handle unexpected spikes in traffic, which fault tolerance technique would be most beneficial?
- Load Shedding

In microservices, how does health check integration in load balancing improve service reliability?
- Dynamic Routing Decisions

The process of dynamically updating the service registry in response to changes is known as _________ in service discovery.
